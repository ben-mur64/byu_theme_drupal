# byu_d8
Drupal 8 Theme using Boostrap &amp; Components


THIS IS NOT A FINAL RELEASE. THIS THEME IS STILL IN BETA MODE.

 Contact Katria Lesser on slack if you have questions about when this will be fully available. We are working out licensing issues and some bug fixes.


INSTALLATION
--------------------
1. Git clone (or download) and Enable the porto, locatat: https://github.com/byuweb/porto
  Current bug: sometimes when you try to enable, it will say `The website encountered an unexpected error.` If you hit back and try to enable it again, it usually works with another try.
2. Git clone (or download) the byu_d8 theme, and enable it.

These sections each have several options.
